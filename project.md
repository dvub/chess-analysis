# Stats Project Details

These are details for the school assignment LOL

## Data Collection

_Type_: Observational Study
_Process_: Using the lichess games database from the month of october (or november?)
_Bias_: I've only downloaded games from the first few days of the month -- assuming that the time of month makes people play chess better (LOL). and of course it's only game data from one month.

## Data Analysis

_Question_: What is the relationship between the amount of time a player has left in chess, and how long their moves take? How is that relationship affected by player skill, time control mode?
_X/Independent; Quantitative_: Time left for a player
_Y/Dependent; Quantitative_: Time taken to make a move, **given an amount of time left**.

### 1-var Data

Both will use
